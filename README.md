AFSE -- Competitive Coders -- Jump-Room group project.

# :warning: Alpha development stage! :warning:

## What is it

JumpRoom is an idea for a website that allows all things related to school, grading, and doing work to be in one place.

We want...

1. :link: To tether all grades to the students account.
2. :mega: Integrate plagiarism detection.
3. :floppy_disk: Integrate AI grading (optional for teacher).
4. :trollface: Custom class designs for teachers.
5. :thought_balloon: Public (and private) messaging system.
6. :negative_squared_cross_mark: Testing software that enforces no cheating.

# Development plans

## * Alpha Stage

- [ ] Go through HTML & CSS course with group to get us all up to speed with designing the website layout
- [ ] Get servers to hold all student, teacher, and class data
- [ ] Design registration (login) system for all users

## * Beta Stage

- [ ] Begin storing data (such as grades, papers, presentations, etc.) in said servers
- [ ] Integrate a usable interface for students & teachers to view their work
- [ ] Allow for the use of AI to assist teachers

## * Release Stage

- [ ] Allow for each class (and individual work) to have a specified grading system (1-100, 1-4, A-B-C, etc.)
- [ ] Let teachers design the layout of their classes (color scheme, side-scrolling photos, etc.)
- [ ] Make a public (and private) chat system for each class & student to communicate with each other and the teacher
- [ ] Develop a testing software integrated with JumpRoom that keeps the student locked into the website (and unable to use any other tabs) while taking the test.
- [ ] :collision: Release and ship publicly!!
